loading data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# traditional CSV "tab separated" (it's big)
raw1gram <- readRDS("../../data/ngrams_v1_years.rds")

head(raw1gram)
```

reading total counts

```{r}

totalCounts <- read_delim("./googlebooks-eng-all-totalcounts-20090715.txt", 
                          delim="\t", skip=1, col_types = "innn",
                          col_names=c("year","total.words","total.pages","total.books"))

head(totalCounts)
```

keeping only years as ngrams

```{r}

years <- raw1gram %>% 
  filter( ngram %in% 1850:2010 ) %>% 
  inner_join(totalCounts, by="year") %>% 
  select(ngram, year, word.count, total.words) %>% 
  mutate(word.freq = word.count/total.words)

head(years)

```

fig 3A

```{r}

years %>% 
  # taking some years
  filter(year>=1850, year <=2000) %>% 
  # the selected years "1grams"
  filter(ngram %in% c(1883,1910,1950)) %>% 
  # plot it
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=word.freq, color=ngram)) +
    geom_line(size=1) +
    theme_light()

```
